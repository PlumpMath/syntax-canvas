Syntax Canvas
=============
Programming language syntax prototying tool, [available online](http://syntaxcanvas.herokuapp.com/).

What is this?
-------------
I think about programming languages a lot. When trying to sketch out a new one, it is frustrating to stare at a wall of unhilighted text. It is also a headache to write a syntax highlighter for a modern text editor, and not even worth the effort because your syntax will be chaniging so rapidly.

So I built this, a tool that lets you sketch out a new syntax and get an idea of what it would look like if it were real. It's been a great help to my practice, and hopefully will be the same to yours.

Heroku? Ruby? What's running this thing?
----------------------------------------
Syntax Canvas is 100% HTML 5 and JavaScript. The Ruby and Heroku setup are the result of an older build and are going away soon.
